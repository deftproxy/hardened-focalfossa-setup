To fix issue where hostname is set to 'localhost', reboot to resolve the issue
If this issue persists, run the following command where 'hostname' is the hostname you would like to set
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname hostname

To fix issue where there is no IP address, do the following: 
edit 00-installer-config.yaml in this directory, change the ip details to the correct settings, save and close (recommend using nano)
example command: 
sudo nano 00-installer-config.yaml
Then, run the following command to set the network information:
sudo cp  00-installer-config.yaml  /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
In VMware, ensure the vm NIC is connected and set to connect at power on
reboot

*You will also need to connect the network in vSphere if the network failed to customize on deploy
